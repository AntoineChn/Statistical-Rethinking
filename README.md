# Statistical Rethinking

This repository represent the joint effort of [Paris Lodron University of Salzburg](https://www.uni-salzburg.at/index.php?id=52) and the [City University of New York Graduate School of Public Health and Health Policy](http://sph.cuny.edu/) in creating an interactive online reading of McElreath's *Statistical Rethinking: A Bayesian Course with Examples in R and Stan*. In each of our weekly meetings, a chapter of the book is presented by a developing instructor with a focus on using the R language. Our meetings are open to all (see details below) and our materials are licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License. We hope you find these materials useful and will join our sessions.

## Presenting

1. Pick the date or topic that best suits you.

2. Edit this file, adding you GitHub username to the schedule table.

3. Read the chapter in the book.

4. Edit the presentation file using RStudio. All presentations should be authored using the `.Rpres` format, more infomation about the format is available [here](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200486468). Additionally, some previous presentation that can be used as examples are available [here](https://github.com/waldronlab/Book_Club/tree/master/Data%20Analysis%20for%20the%20Life%20Sciences).

5. Commit the presentation to GitHub from RStudio so that it is available to others. Don't know what that means? The process is documented [here](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200532077-Version-Control-with-Git-and-SVN) or there is a video [here](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/rstudio-essentials-webinar-series-managing-part-2/).

6. Present your hard work at the weekly meeting!
